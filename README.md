## Social Media App

This is a simple social media application developed to demonstrate basic functionalities of a social platform. It leverages the [Jsonplaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to provide a realistic and diverse set of data for testing and development purposes.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Vite: A fast development build tool for modern web projects.

- TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

- Tanstack React Query: A powerful data-fetching and state-management library for React.

## Features

- User Login: Log in using an existing userId from the Jsonplaceholder API. Example userIds: 1, 2, 3, etc.

- Protected Routes: Only logged-in users can access pages beyond the login and homepage.

- Static Data: The app uses static data from Jsonplaceholder. Any posts or comments created within the app will not affect the data since it is non-persistent.
